## Reverse an Array
Given an array as an input, write a function that returns a new array with elements in reversed order of original array.  

## Whiteboard Process  

![Alt text](Imgs/img1.PNG?raw=true "directory")  
![Alt text](Imgs/img2.PNG?raw=true "directory")  

## Approach & Efficiency

- Prompted user to pass the items of the list as an input.
- Used while loop to get last element of the list.
- Appended captured item in a new list.
- Returned new list when the iteration was complete in original list.
